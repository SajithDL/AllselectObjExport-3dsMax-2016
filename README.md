# AllselectObjExport-3dsMax-2016
A script for 3ds Max 2016 to export all selected objects into individual OBJ files.

## Description

This script, specifically designed for 3ds Max 2016, allows users to export all currently selected objects in the scene to individual OBJ files. Each object will be exported to the "Downloads/AllselectObjExport" directory under the user's scripts folder.

## Installation

1. Place the `AllselectObjExport.ms` script in your 3ds Max 2016 scripts directory.
2. You can run the script in 3ds Max through the MAXScript editor or by dragging and dropping the script file into the 3ds Max viewport.

## Usage

1. Open 3ds Max 2016 and select the objects you want to export.
2. Run the script.
3. Each selected object will be exported as an OBJ file in the "Downloads/AllselectObjExport" directory.

## Notes

- Ensure that the objects you wish to export have unique names to prevent overwriting files.
- The script will automatically create the "AllselectObjExport" directory in your Downloads folder if it doesn't exist.
- Check the MAXScript Listener for any messages or errors during the export process.
